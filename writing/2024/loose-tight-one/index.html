          Loose, tight, one is framework for thinking about the evolution of a
          system where a system is a set of things that work together as part of
          a mechanism. It is a way of understanding a continuous system, one
          with no beginning nor end. Loose, tight, one can help you understand
          the prior, current, and future state of a system. A system such as a
          nation, field of technology, or our very own existence. Loose, tight,
          one is a framework for thinking about everything.
        </p>
        <h2>Loose</h2>
        <p>
          Looseness is the disconnection between one and its environment. One,
          as the entity the system is viewed from, has not discovered the
          entirety of the system. In such a state, one will first observe, then
          question, and finally explore the system. The process of such
          exploration and discovery is referred to as tightness.
        </p>
        <h2>Tight</h2>
        <p>
          Tightness is the discovery of a system, and it is state in motion,
          where looseness is the start point and oneness is the end point. A
          system that becomes more tight reaches closer towards the one state.
        </p>
        <h2>One</h2>
        <p>
          Oneness is the understanding and full discovery of a system. When a
          system has reached a state of one, it means all possibilities have
          occurred, or can be understood and meta-experiences through some sort
          of abstraction, an abstraction refers to a simulation. When a system
          has reached the state of one, nothing else is to be discovered within
          it, and out of this achievement a new system is born, where the state
          of one act as the new foundation. This new foundation opens the
          opportunity for a system to become loose again, and so the evolution
          continues of loose, tight, one, ad infinitum.

        <h2>Systems</h2>
        <p>
          All natural systems follow this cycle of looseness, tightening, and
          then the state of one. Loose, tight, one is an infinitesimal system
          which does not end. A system will first start out loose, without a
          very much good understanding nor connection to its environment. As a
          system becomes tighter the entities within a system become more
          connected until they are all connected. At this point, the systems
          become one. When a one state is reached, the cycle starts again. The
          new system allows for a new frontier, and in effect a new looseness
          for this frontier is formed- this frontier is of course a system to be
          discovered. The cycle shall continue ad infinitum.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <h3>Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
          Intelligence is going through a tightening phase, and it is so much so
          that we can see the one state. Artificial intelligence is a
          culmination of all human thought and experience, that specifically of
          large language models. As these models become ever so powerful to a
          point when they are sentient, then we will have reached a one state.
          At this point all human intelligence will be added to these machines
          whereby no more is needed. This system will then be able to reason for
          themselves, thus ending the need for humans and beginning a new stage
          of evolution. This new stage is reached only after the tightening of
          intelligence has reached it’s one state.
        </p>
        <h3>Self</h3>
        <p>
          A state of one would be the realization of one’s self. An
          unfortunality is that many individyals will never discover this state
          of oneness. A state of one for the self is an understanding and
          overcoming of ones trifes and weaknesses. An invidiual may always be
          stuck in the limbo of tightness whereby they never truly reach
          enlightenment. Or they could stay at a loose level, where they never
          acknowledge nor strive to discover themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Humanity</h3>
        <p>
          Where are we, why are we here, and why did we get here? These three
          question hold us within the same system. When we understand all these
          question we will have reached a state of one. Our general
          understanding of everything is an abstraction of loose, tight, one.
        </p>
        <h2>Becoming</h2>
        <p>
          A path towards one is of only one direction, it is a vector. When the
          system of loose, tight, one is finite then it can appear that one is
          going backwards instead of forwards, yet that is not the case, it is
          simply a stall. A system will stall, although never go backwards. When
          a system stalls too long, long enough whereby it cannot reach a level
          a state of one, then it some much as to will appear that it has gone
          backwards. The question is this: “what must the entity do?” Should the
          entity stall further, or should it resume on its path towards
          tightening, yet knowing that it will never reach a state of one? The
          answer is obvious, and it is the later, for there is no objection that
          the entity will not reach a state of one. The entity will only make
          this judgement based on prior decision of the pass, and it therefore
          makes a decision that has no relevance towards the present. Therefore
          a system must always strive for oneness even when the perceived
          probability is low, it actuality it is undefined. One may never no
          until ones has achieved a state of one. This is a very long way of
          saying, do not give up, do not stop, and do not allow the prior
          determine the future.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Loose, tight, one is a framework for how to think. It is a systematic
          approach toward the word “becoming.” Becoming of the self, becoming of
          humanity, etc.
