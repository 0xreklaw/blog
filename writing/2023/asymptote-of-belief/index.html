          Since the dawn of time, we have found purpose in the belief of a
          higher ideal. Religion, wealth, identity; these are all examples of
          what I call asymptote beliefs. Like an asymptotic line, a belief is
          something that elevates you to a higher ideal, yet a point that you
          will never reach.
          <b>Belief is a perpetual practice that never ends.</b>

        <p>
          As you will notice in the graph, a belief or an ideal is the
          foundation for your life. As you believe more in an ideal you will
          elevate your life and find more purpose in it. The more purpose you’ve
          gained from this belief, the more you will believe in the belief. Each
          feeding into each other like a perpetual motion machine, you will find
          purpose out of nothing. As I will go onto explain, there have been
          three major beliefs through recorded history: religion, wealth, and
          identity. These three examples are all collective beliefs. A
          collective belief is a fundamental ideal that is understood by the
          majority, and it dominates the way a society thinks, feels, operates,
          and accelerates into the future.
        </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>
          The first asymptote belief was religion, believe in a higher ideal and
          you will live a good life. In reality, most people did not live great
          or humane lives when religion was the most dominant form of belief.
          This was during times when disease was common, living conditions were
          despicable, and jobs were long and unforgiving. Religion gave people a
          why when they shouldn’t of had one. Having a why, defines your
          existence and pushes you past hardships. Religion was the first
          example of a collective belief because it gave people a purpose in a
          purposeless world. If you pray, be a good citizen, then maybe you
          would reach the higher ideal of morality, heaven. And if you did not,
          then you would go somewhere much worse than your current reality,
          hell. As rough as life may have been, people had something to look
          forward to, reaching heaven, and something to fear, going to hell.
          Religion kept people ground, in line, and something to base their life
          on.
        </p>
        <h2>Wealth</h2>
        <p>
          Wealth was the second asymptotic belief. Developed out of the
          renaissance and industrial revolution, the crave for money and power
          propelled humanity forward. As Ricky Bobby says nicely “If you ain’t
          first, you’re last.” Although blunt, the darwinian statement is a good
          summary of what capitalism is, a race; if you are not moving up, then
          you are moving down. Someone will always be working harder than you,
          and this constant insecurity/fear of falling down in the world
          hierarchy, gives people a purpose the same way religion does. The
          ideal of wealth is the belief in money and power, the more of these
          you gain, the higher up in society you will move. Wealth hit center
          stage with capitalism which gave people a purpose through the output
          they produced. At its heights during the late 1800’s and mid to late
          1900’s, the belief in wealth slowly transgressed into something else.
        </p>
        <h2>Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Identity is the forth coming asymptotic belief. As Nietzsche said,
          “God is Dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.” Younger
          generations no longer accept religion, and they are growing wary of
          the rat race of capitalism. Out of the downfall of both collective
          beliefs, a third idea has emerged, identity. Post religion and
          industrialism, more and more people have identified themselves with
          the LGBTQ+ community. This is the belief and exploration of sex,
          gender, sexuality and perception oneself. Just like in the Middle
          Ages, you could never pray enough, in the industrial age you could
          never have enough power, now you will never fully understand yourself
          enough. We can see this today with people experiencing gender
          dysphoria or displeasure with ones orientation with themselves. This
          displeasure makes individuals look inside and question themselves.
          Like a female that has changed their gender to a male, they will never
          be masculine enough, it is therefore their purpose in life to reach
          the ideal of what a man is.
        </p>
        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Belief is a fundamental to society, without it we would not have a
          purpose in life. Throughout history we have seen the collective belief
          change, first with religion, then with wealth, and now with identity.
          All instances are examples of asymptote beliefs because they have no
          end state. Just like an asymptote, there is no end, you can only get
          closer and closer, but never find a true end state. In religion you
          could never pray enough, and if you did believe you could like the
          papal states of the late Middle Ages did, then your belief was turned
          to something else wealth. With wealth, you could never work enough,
          but when people realized had enough, they looked toward something
          else. Now people are looking into the mirror and finding a purpose
          through their identity. All beliefs are perpetual unrealized goals,
          you can never pray enough, you can never work enough, and you will
          never know yourself enough.
