        <h2>TLDR</h2>
        <p>
          Web3 allows you to have direct ownership over your digital identity.
        </p>
        <h2>Physical v. Digital World</h2>
        <p>
          The world we live in today is two-fold, comprising both the real world
          and the virtual world. The real world is where we live and breathe, it
          is constrained by the laws of physics and is made up of molecules and
          atoms. Alternatively, the virtual world is where an increasing amount
          of our time resides, and it is constrained only by our computational
          power, imagination, and will; the virtual world is made up of bits.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both worlds we represent ourselves through our identity. As defined
          by Oxford Languages, your identity, “is the fact of being who or what
          you or thing is.” Between the real and virtual worlds our identities
          slightly differ, and I highlight this idea below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Physical Identity:</b> is our identity in the real world. It is
            defined by our qualities, beliefs, traits, relationships and is
            encapsulated through our appearance and actions.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Digital Identity:</b> is our identity in the virtual world. It is
            defined by our interactions and transactions and is encapsulated
            through our data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Identity is a complex topic, and these definitions are an
          oversimplification, but for the purpose of this article they help you
          understand the difference between your identity in the real and
          virtual worlds. One key idea to understand the difference between your
          physical and digital identity is on the idea of how it is contained.
          In the real world our identities are constrained by our bodies, yet
          this is not the case with our identities in the virtual world. In the
          virtual world, our identities are scatted all throughout the internet,
          I explain this below.
        </p>
        <h2>A Scattered Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Our digital identities are currently scattered throughout the
          internet, encompassing various aspects of our lives. We have social
          identities on platforms like Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, and Snapchat.
          Our professional identities are established on platforms like
          LinkedIn, Slack, and Salesforce, while our creative identities are
          expressed on platforms like YouTube, Etsy, and Medium. Additionally,
          our financial identities are tied to platforms like Robinhood,
          Fidelity, and Coinbase. Despite the diversity of platforms, we do not
          own any part of our identity that resides on the internet, which
          presents a significant problem. If we were to apply this concept to
          the real world, it would mean that Instagram owns our sight, LinkedIn
          controls who we can network with, YouTube dictates our creative
          expression, and Fidelity governs our financial transactions. These
          ideas are inherently absurd, and the more we contemplate them, the
          more we realize the importance of taking ownership of our digital
          identity.
        </p>
        <h2>The Point</h2>
        <p>
          As we increasingly spend more of our lives in the virtual world than
          in the real world, it becomes crucial to ensure that we have the same
          control and rights over our identity. This is the purpose of Web3, to
          grant individual direct ownership over their digital identity. By
          allowing individuals to take control over their identity, Web3 aims to
          create a more secure and decentralized internet that is more conducive
          to trust, privacy, and autonomy.
