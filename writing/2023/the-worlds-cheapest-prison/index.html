        The world's cheapest prison. It's so cheap, you wouldn't believe that it's free, you wouldn't believe that it is the internet. The place where over X number of Americans
        spend X% of there daily lives.
        
        A prison is simply a buffer in your life, some times it is your life. If sentenced to 5 years, then you'll only lose about a good 5 years in the real world. But if you spend
        life in prison, well then that idea becomes your reality.
        
        Private Prisons and Private Companies
        Most prison companies are private companies. They work by simply the number of prisoners they can facilitate at one time. Therefore, it is in these companies best interests to get low
        offending crimes into the prisons. Like picking the cherry of some what innocent people, just to fill cells and turn a profit. This idea isn't much different from big tech today, 
        in fact it's quite actually the same. Your attention is prayed on by advertisers, seeking to influence your spending habits.
        
        Society has imprisoned itself
        
        We've imprisoned ourself to debt with cheap as dirt gambling, gambling that is actually encouraged. 
        
        We are imprisoned into a false sense of self and ideas through the self reinforcing algorithms that ultimately determine our digital reality. TikTok is a good example of 
        making kids depressed a suidical for recommending self harm content. The internet will make you someone who you are not.
        
        We are imprisoned. Our every move is tracked over the interet. There are back doors built into each private company. Even companies who we thought we independent (Ledger) 
        still had back doors. The patriot act did not free us, it enslaved us. Let's see where this continues in 2024 (link to bill act)
        
        We are imprisoned to emotion. Humans are both rational and emotional beings, yet social media bring more and more of our primal selves out. We are trained for cheap dopamine and 
        attention, we are literally deevolging our own species (literacy rates in us).
        
        We are imprisoned to fantasies. Pornography destroys the soul, and biohacks the fundamental code of the universe, love. We don't know how to love anymore, we don't even know how to have sex.
        
        We are improsed to shallowness. People only care about likes, views, followers, and money. People aren't genuine anymore, they are shallow. How depressing it is to live some times.
        
        We are imprisoned to ourselves. Everything on the internet is perminant and it is only becoming more so. I am responsible for something I said 10 years ago even though today I am a completely 
        different person. People are afraid to live at the expense of being cancled by a toxic virus. People are afraid to speak, afraid to act, and afraid to live. This last one is only anti-life.
        
        You can probaly think of more examples, but the picture is obvious, we are surroneded by a prison 24/7/365.
        
        Authors Note
        Now I do not believe that all of the internet is a prison, but many modern parts are drstically similar to imprisonment of some sort. I want to build a better internet, because I too have 
        fallen victim to many of these fallacies. I have let to much of my life be imprisoned by these ideas. There is a solution, and that is forward, we must keep building for the good of humanity.
