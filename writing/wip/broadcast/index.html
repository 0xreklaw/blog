        Already this month two projects have launchd will make you question what
        is real and what is not even further. Pika Labs a generative ai video
        startup allows imagine anything you want and put it in video format.
        https://pika.art/waitlist Impressive as it is, I recently stumbled upon
        an even more advance generative model on X.
        https://humanaigc.github.io/animate-anyone/ Take a minute to click these
        resources and understand the magnitude of what this means moving
        forward, for me it certainly meant that more and more information will
        be generative, fake, and almost impossible to tell apart what is real
        versus what is not.
