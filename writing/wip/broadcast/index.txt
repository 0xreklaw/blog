## Generative Media & Deepfakes
Deepfakes have been in the known since the 2016 elections, where they were used to create spoof videos, although the 
quality then was no where comparable to today's deepfakes. 

Already this month two projects have launchd will make you question what is real and what is not even further. Pika 
Labs a generative ai video startup allows imagine anything you want and put it in video format. https://pika.art/waitlist
Impressive as it is, I recently stumbled upon an even more advance generative model on X. https://humanaigc.github.io/animate-anyone/
Take a minute to click these resources and understand the magnitude of what this means moving forward, for me it certainly 
meant that more and more information will be generative, fake, and almost impossible to tell apart what is real versus
what is not.

Generative media is very quite interesting and there are many thesis's around how it will impact media production and consumption,
this topic in itself could be another essay. Yet for the purpose of this post, I'd like to focus the impacts it will have on 
news reporting, or thus how can we mitigate the falseness of these videos, as generative media becomes inevitable?

## Walled Gardens, Corporations, and Citizen Journalism
Social networks and media companies constitute much of the information we see. Thinking about what news is from a first
principles perspective, it is plainly a projection of an event reported from an individuals point of view.

News is a subset of social networks, but it is not for media companies, media companies profit off the emotion they yield
for their subjectively biased reporting. A news corporation is not a business, and therefore its duty is not to report what is
true, but what is true enough to draw emotion in their viewership.

## Due Diligence & Notes
Due diligence in finance- ensure that my investment is viable. If I make this investment, I want to know that I'm investing
in a trustworthy and well rounded entity.

The same should be true for news, I should be able to act on information that I know is not fake, from the perspective that
confirms my bias, etc. 

The closest thing we have to this is Community Notes.

Closing Thoughts

How do we discern reality? How do we know what is real and what is not?

How do we discern reality? In the real world that question is quite easy to answer, 
our five senses are what help us navigate how we see the world. 
These include sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. 

The senses that help us very much navigate the real world, are not applied equally to the digital world,
and as more and more of our lives transfer over to the digital world, we are left with an inherent gap.
What is real over the internet, and how do we verify its authenticity?

In the digital world, our reality is heavily left to two primary senses: sight and hearing.
And it makes sense that these senses do the heavy lifting, as they are the primary senses that we use to navigate the world.

The question is how do we ensure that what we see and hear over the internet is actually true?

Fortunately, there is no novel idea on how to solve this problem. In fact we have the tech and the means to implement it.
In the following paragraphs I present a case on how to authenticaly broadcast news over the internet.

Deepfakes:
Within the last two weeks there have already been significant developments in AI video.

And as most of our digital existence is consumed via video, it will become ever so difficualt to discern what is real and what is generated by a cluster of GPUs.

History of News and reporting

- next??

As we go down the line, the news becomes more authentic and raw, yet at the same time, it is shown in a more niche and 
subjective view. So can you prove that a live video is shown or cut in a way to demonstrate a specific narrative?
That a picture has been altered or cropped?

Cryptograpically verity the location, dimensionality, proof of occurence, etc. And store it all on chain.

A blockchain is a way to securely store history, as created by Satoshi, Bitcoin was origanally refered to as the time chain.
https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Timechain#:~:text=The%20word%20Timechain%20can%20be,end%20up%20being%20included%20in.

A blockchain enables you to securly store information over the internet in a way where no one party can control it,
because of this property it is good for one, storing important information. I can name really only three valid use cases to 
store anything on chain, 1. as a means of money, 2. identity, 3. information that is crucial for the fabric of soceity.

News falls under the third grey category. And although a blockahin an offer a way to store news in a permisionless, secure,
and verifieable way, it does not offer a way to distribute it in an unbiased way. That is the importance of the interface. 
The feed is currently...

Proof of Personhood

One way to prove you are indeed a human can be by paying $8 a month

Another alternative would be using a web of trust model, whereby a user links existing social media accounts
and verify them through an authentication session.

By displaying their other profiles, they thus create a more established profile that can be cross-referenced
for inherent bias or in general to verity that they are indeed human.

Although this method is a step up from no form of authentication, it can be further improved upon by other means
of proving humanness over the internet

How to limit bias?

Netowrks have not seen any change in ui since the early 2000'scale

The only this that has changed about the feed is how content is fed to you.

Feeds were first subscription based, then network based, and now algorithmically based.

The question entails, if our inforamtion is fine tuned to a specific prefence, are we obtainting a worldy view
that enables us to make rational deicisions? In my opinion, the answer is now, and that has become every so apparent 
with the divide in our country.

We cannot be ignorant of the fact that as technolgy evovles, the world becomes more niche and tight,
but it is important especially for a rational soceity that news be fed in a way that does not reinforce and existing
bias. 

Interface 2.0- a world view
Snapchat made maps popular. At any moment in time, you can see where your friends are, if you want to see what going on in 
nyc you can just tap there and see someones story. This is a very interest UI choice, and I think it is personally
underutilized. 

"Tap to see the world"

What SnapChat has wrong is that you are essentially seeing a subscription. Whereever you tap, you are seeing an arbitrary post, 
irrelated to what you actuall yare interest in querying. For example if I want to see what is going on in NYC, but 
I only want to see what is going on in terms of policing and violence, then I should be able to add a parameter. 

Walled Garden
All news is a walled garden. 
New York Times (Literally, you have to pay to see)
Insatgram, TikTok, etc. Need an acount to signup, furthermore you cannot call the articles via api 
There is no certainty with these solutions

Closing Notes

News should be unbiased in the way we consume it. The process of obtaining news should be frictionless, and as easy as a tap on a map.
You should easily be able to do due dilligence on the reporter.
And you should be able to verify that it is indeed real.

These clauses satsify the statement of proving reality in a digital sense.
