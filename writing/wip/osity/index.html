        Proof of Personhood: - Web of Trust - KYC (third party) - Biometrics -
        Continuous Authentication (New) Why is this important? 1. deepfakes and
        that of the non human 2. humanness 3. prevention against impersonnatino
        and theft

        First principles, I am Bob, this is me. How do we prove that Bob is Bob?
        We can do so through multiple means. 1. Does Bob look like Bob?
        (Biometrics) 2. Is Bob acting the way Bob usually does (Web of Trust) 3.
        Bob's drivers license and passport say he is Bob (KYC) 4. Bob is Bob
        Authentication Sessions 1. Prove who I am on a timely basis, but
        sessions can be hacked 2. Sessions tell you a user is authenticated, but
        it does not tell you who the user (This statement is false for
        biometrics and tightly concealed systems) Why CA works: CA works because
        you look at how a system works and create a session on the workings of
        such a system. This approach is used instead of looking at one part of a
        system. If one part of a system is compromised, the system is
        compromised. In CA, you are able to look at the system as a continous
        whole, a system that is constatnly changing and a session that changes
        with you. Extremes: 1. I can lose my fingers, face, or other biometrics,
        a lose access to whatever I'm trying to authenticate (that is why a
        password is still a fallback) 2. I can lose my password, and therefore
        biometrics are a fallback What I cannot lose is the self, I will always
        exist in some form, and therefore I will always be able to authenticate
        myself. An authentication should only end, once you've ended. Tradeoffs
        Authenticated in sessions- - weakest but also don't need to be
        authenticated Authenticated in sessions with biometrics- - stronger and
        more seamless, but severe security concerns Autheicated Contnually -
        strongest and most seamless, on you 24/7 (wristband, implant, continous
        monitoring, etc.)
